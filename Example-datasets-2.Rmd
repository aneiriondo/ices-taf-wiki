This page was based on using the `icesTAF` package version ```r packageVersion("icesTAF")```
dated ```r packageDate("icesTAF")```.  

This example requires a package to be installed that is not on CRAN. Please ensure you have the
package `stockasessment` by running
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Download and install stockassessment in R
install.packages("stockassessment", repos = "https://fishfollower.r-universe.dev")
```

The resulting TAF analysis created from this example is 
on GitHub: [github.com/ices-taf-dev/wiki-example-2](https://github.com/ices-taf-dev/wiki-example-2),
if you dont want to build up the code yourself by following the example, you can skip to the end 
and run on your computer by downloading the complete code and running it like this:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# get code
run_dir <- download.analysis("ices-taf-dev/wiki-example-2")
# view downloaded code
browseURL(run_dir)

# run analysis
run.analysis(run_dir)
# view result
browseURL(run_dir)
```

## Creating an empty TAF project

First we create an empty TAF project, and in this case we will call it `example-1`, and then moving our
working directory to this folder. We do this by running

```{r}
taf.skeleton("example-2")
setwd("example-2")
```

resulting in the following:
```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
tafdir <- "example-2"
# get skeleton path structure
paths <- dir(tafdir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
paths <- c(paste0(tafdir, "/bootstrap/initial/data/"), paths)
printDir(paths)
```

## Adding SAM input data via a bootstrap script

Tso get the input data for a stock asseement run on 
[stockassessment.org/](https://stockassessment.org/), we can use a short script. It is provided here
as code that will create the script for you - normally you would create these scripts yourself.

```{r, echo=-1}
setwd(tafdir)

cat('library(stockassessment)

# download model from stockassessment.org
fit <- fitfromweb("WBCod_2021_cand01")

# save to model folder
save(fit, file = "fit.rData")

',
  file = "bootstrap/sam_fit.R"
)
```

bootsrap scripts such as this one, goes in the `bootstrap` folder:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
paths <- dir(tafdir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```

a second script to get the fitted model object is given below:

```{r, echo=-1}
setwd(tafdir)

cat('sam_assessment <- "WBCod_2021_cand01"

sam_dir <-
  paste0(
    "https://stockassessment.org/datadisk/stockassessment/userdirs/user3/",
    sam_assessment,
    "/data/"
  )

files <-
  paste0(
    c("cn", "cw", "dw", "lf", "lw", "mo", "nm", "pf", "pm", "survey", "sw"),
    ".dat"
  )

for (file in files) {
  download(paste0(sam_dir, file))
}

',
  file = "bootstrap/sam_data.R"
)
```

We can then add records for these scripts in the DATA.bib file using:

```{r, echo=-1}
setwd(tafdir)
draft.data(
  data.files = NULL,
  data.scripts = c("sam_data", "sam_fit"),
  originator = "WGBFAS",
  title = c("SAM input data for ...", "SAM fitted object for ..."),
  year = 2021,
  period = "1985-2020",
  file = TRUE,
  append = FALSE
)
```

resulting the project looking like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
paths <- dir(tafdir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```


and after running
```{r, echo = -1}
setwd(tafdir)
taf.bootstrap()
```
your project should now look like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE, results="asis"}
paths <- dir(tafdir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```

Now we have a folder with the same name as the script we created, and inside this is any files
created by the script.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
unlink("example-2", recursive = TRUE)
```

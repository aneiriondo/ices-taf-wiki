# Creating a TAF analysis

The first step in creating a TAF analysis is to set out the basic folder and file structure of the project.
This is done using the function [`taf.skeleton`](https://rdrr.io/cran/icesTAF/man/taf.skeleton.html)
which creates the following structure in your working directory

```{r taf-skeleton-output, results='asis'}
icesTAF::taf.skeleton("test")
paths <- dir("test", full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
paths <- c("test/bootstrap/initial/data/", paths)
data.tree::as.Node(data.frame(pathString = paths))
```

* [Finding a TAF analysis](#finding-a-taf-analysis)


## Finding an analysis

The first step is finding a TAF analysis that you want to run.  All TAF stock assessments
are made available on the [TAF web application](https://taf.ices.dk/app/about) 
(see screenshot below). There are publicly avilable analyses and private ones.  Private 
analyses have not yet been made publicly available and require to be reviewed. Public 
analyses are accessed by clicking the "see publlic demo" button, and private analyses are 
accessed by clicking the "Manage stock assessments" button - this is only available to 
logged in users of the ICES network and specifically to members of ICES stock assessment 
working groups.

In the following example we will select the 2019 sandeel in area 6 assessment, and the 
application gives a link to the github repository for the code as 
[`github.com/ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6`](https://github.com/ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6). 
as seen below:

## Getting the code

From the previous section we have found the github address of the code we want to run, however we
only need the name of the repository which is: `ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6`.  The following code
will download the code into a directory that you specify, otherwise it will download
into a temporary directory on your computer (default).  In this case we will choose the current
working directory (specified by `"."`) that your R sessions is running in (see `getwd()` to find out what this is).

```{r}
run_dir <- download.analysis("ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6", dir = ".")
```

which results in the following files and directories:
```{r taf-skeleton-output, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
# get skeleton path structure
paths <- dir(run_dir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```

## Running the code

There are three steps to running a TAF analysis.

1. install all relavant packages: `install.deps()`
2. run the data and software boot procedure: `taf.bootstrap()`
3. run the TAF analysis scripts: `sourceAll()`

### 1. install all relavant packages: `install.deps()`

Some analyses may use R packages that are widely available but that you do not have installed
on your own computer. The `deps()` function provides a list of packages used in an analysis,
for example in the example we are working with we have:
```{r}
deps(run_dir)
```

and the following function installs all of those packages that you do not have installed
```{r}
install.deps()
```

### 2. run the data and software boot procedure: `taf.bootstrap()`

the next step is to run `taf.bootstrap()`.  But before we do this we need to set the working
direcory to the location of the TAF scripts.  Note here that the function `setwd()` returns the
current working directory so we can return to where we were when we are finished.
```{r}
oldwd <- setwd(run_dir)
taf.bootstrap()
setwd(oldwd)
```

which gathers data and software specified in the `DATA.bib` and `SOFTWARE.bib` files, and
results in the following
```{r taf-bootstrap-output, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
paths <- dir(run_dir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```

notice that there is a new folder `bootstrap/data` which contains files that can now be used
by the TAF analysis scripts in the next section.

### 3. run the TAF analysis scripts: `sourceAll()`

The final step is to run `sourceAll()`, which runs, in sequence, the `data.R`, `model.R`, 
`output.R` and `report.R` scripts.
```{r}
oldwd <- setwd(run_dir)
sourceAll()
setwd(oldwd)
```

and gives us the complete output from the TAF analyses.
```{r taf-sourceall-output, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
paths <- dir(run_dir, full.names = TRUE, recursive = TRUE)
printDir(paths)
```

## Rounding up

The files in the TAF analyses we have just run should the same as on the [TAF web application
page](https://taf.ices.dk/app/demo#!/2019/san.sa.6).  Differences can occur in some more complicated
analyses, and this is to be expected with differences in software between different machines.

All together, to get and run a TAF analysis stored on a GitHub reposuitory, run the following lines
of code in R:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# get code
run_dir <- download.analysis("ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6", dir = ".")
# install packages
install.deps()
# run
oldwd <- setwd(run_dir)
taf.bootstrap()
sourceAll()
setwd(oldwd)
```


```{r cleanup, echo = FALSE}
unlink(run_dir, recursive = TRUE)
```

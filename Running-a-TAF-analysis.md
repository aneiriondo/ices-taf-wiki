## Finding an analysis

The first step is finding a TAF analysis that you want to run. All TAF
stock assessments are made available on the [TAF web
application](https://taf.ices.dk/app/about) (see screenshot below).
There are publicly avilable analyses and private ones. Private analyses
have not yet been made publicly available and require to be reviewed.
Public analyses are accessed by clicking the “see publlic demo” button,
and private analyses are accessed by clicking the “Manage stock
assessments” button - this is only available to logged in users of the
ICES network and specifically to members of ICES stock assessment
working groups.

In the following example we will select the 2019 sandeel in area 6
assessment, and the application gives a link to the github repository
for the code as `ices-taf/2019_san.sa.6`. as seen below:

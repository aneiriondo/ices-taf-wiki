## Finding an analysis

The first step is finding a TAF analysis that you want to run. All TAF
stock assessments are made available on the [TAF web
application](https://taf.ices.dk/app/about). There are publicly avilable
analyses and private ones. Private analyses have not yet been made
publicly available and require to be reviewed. Public analyses are
accessed by clicking the “see publlic demo” button, and private analyses
are accessed by clicking the “Manage stock assessments” button - this is
only available to logged in users of the ICES network and specifically
to members of ICES stock assessment working groups.
